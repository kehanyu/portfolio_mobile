		<p>Xintiandi is a very popular entertainment district bang smack in the 
            heart of Shanghai. If you are looking for dinner, drinks and a good 
            night out in Shanghai, then this is where you should be! It really is 
            one of the best things to do in Shanghai if you want a night on the town. 
            That being said, you can expect a more laid back vibe here rather than 
            the upbeat Nanjing Road.</p>

		<p>Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant in Old Shanghai serves up Shanghai's 
            most famous dumplings and soup dumplings, is it a bit of a tourist trap?! 
            Yes! However the dumplings are delicious and if you are visiting the old 
            town it's a must, expect queues and avoid on weekends though! If you are in 
            a hurry there is also a stand-up bar outside where you can order too.</p>

        <p>Tianzifang is one of my favourite places to visit in Shanghai and amongst its 
            labyrinth-like alleyways are lots of small boutique-style cafes, restaurants 
            and bars and lots of street food to choose from. Make sure to go hungry as there 
            are snack stalls at every corner. The street food is an eccentric mix of traditional 
            Chinese food, western food and everything in between. Tianzifang is also known as 
            the Soho of Shanghai, it’s an eccentric and artsy area in the city. It’s been transformed 
            from old traditional shikumen stone houses which were former back streets of the French 
            Concession to now housing cafes, bars, boutiques and design studios. It’s full of creativity 
            even the old walls are used as canvases to display street art and sculptures, and with 
            every turn you see something different. It’s also a great spot to visit for food as there 
            is so much choice, so make sure to go hungry!</p>
